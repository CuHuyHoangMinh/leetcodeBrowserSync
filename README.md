# leetcodeBrowserSync
create a .env file and add the following in:

ex: 
leetcodecsrftoken={you get this by inspecting leetcode.com, login, go to network and find the package you are sending}
leetcodesession={same as above}
gitToken={create your github token make sure to give permission to edit the repo you want to add it}
gitUser={your github username}
gitRepo={the name of the repo}


make sure you give it permission to read/write to the folder it is as. 

run App.java


(in testing, it works, need to create better blob so it wont hit the API limit)
